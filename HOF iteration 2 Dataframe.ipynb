Starting with a set of csv data files obtained from the Baseball Databank (acq. from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/), I used a variety of Pandas methods to prepare the data into a single, aggregated data source containing a collection of relevant variables. \n",
    "In a previous iteration of this project, I used several machine learning classification algorithms to classify and predict whether baseball players would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. That project utilized 5 dependent variables, all related to players' hitting performance; this project's dataset contains over 20 features covering the players' hitting and fielding, as well as their All Star and award nominations. Ideally, this more robust dataset will lead to more accurate and statistically significant results when the classification algorithms are applied in future steps.\n",

Initially I had wanted to track Zone Rating as a coverall metric for fielding aptitude, but a cursory look into the data revealed that ZR data was only available for 41 players, so the metric was abandoned in favor of others. Other data cleaning actions taken were the removal of pitchers (due to differences in statistics, this project will only look at hitters), the selection of relevant performance metrics, and filling empty data with 0's to allow for aggregation and stat calculation."

    "A major problem with the data I imported was that it contained only season-by-season stats, while this project is concerned with overall career stats. Therefore, I needed to find a way to group the data by player, and sum it all up to create career-length aggregate stats. In a previous iteration of this project, I did this by creating a function to iterate over the data and sum it, but this method was very computationally expensive, so in the following cells I tried 2 different methods to aggregate the data. Both methods seem to do the job, however a preliminary test (demonstrated below) reveals that method 2 is much faster. As such it will primarily be used for the rest of this notebook, with the exception of the batting dataframe."

    "## Batting\n",
    "In my previous iteration of this project idea, I tracked only 5 features for each player, all of which focused on hitting (G, AB, H, HR, BA). In this version, along with features from other categories (fielding, awards), I have also added more batting variables. Primarily, this includes calculations of rate stats (on base percentage, slugging percentage, and on-base-plus-slugging), which will hopefully encompass much more variation in players' skills and performance. I also added doubles, triples, RBI's, walks, and strikeouts, as well as stolen bases to cover players' baserunning ability. \n",
    "At this point the Batting dataframe still contains stats for pitchers who hit at some point in their careers. Unlike the Fielding dataframe, the batting data doesn't have a position column so it was impossible to isolate pitchers. Therefore, they appear in these calculations (ie playerID 'abbotji01' on row 1 below is pitcher Jim Abbott), though they will be removed later when the dataframes are merged. "

Several variables (TB, AB, HBP) were necessary for the calculation of these rate stats but contain little useful information on their own, so they were dropped from the dataframe after the rate stats were added."

This will be resolved later by merging the Allstar dataframe to the rest of the data via an outer join, and replacing the 'NaN' datapoints with 0's to reflect those players' 0 allstar appearances. "

Finally, I used a series of lambda functions to convert the strings in the __awardID__ column into seperate binary columns, where a 1 would indicate whether the player won a specific award in a certain year. Finally, I aggregated these binary values to produce a dataframe with total counts for each award for each player across their whole career. "

The data is then grouped by __playerID__ and the max value of __inducted_bin__ is selected; this will leave us with a single datapoint for each player (many players appeared on multiple ballots before being inducted/rejected, so this step filters out the extraneous data).

    "Finally, the binary classification variable __inducted_bin__ is added to the dataframe. While reviewing the data, I noticed that 44 pitchers had made it into the final dataset; these pitchers had won gold gloves or MVP's at some point in their career and had thus snuck past the filters. This was skewing the data distribution (since all pitchers were removed from the hitting and fielding data, their rows were empty save for the awards). Thankfully they made up the final 44 rows of the dataframe, so it was easy to simply drop them by index. This leaves us with a final 774 x 22 data matrix (22 features are tracked for a total of 774 players). This higher-dimensional data should hopefully add much more accuracy to the model than in my previous iteration, which only tracked 5 features."

    "The application of statistical and classification methods to this data will be documented in a separate notebook. The primary objective is to design one (or several) models which will be able to predict, within a reasonable degree of accuracy, whether a player can be expected to recieve a Hall of Fame induction given their career performace as reflected in the above metrics. Additionally, the analysis will also reveal the degree to which each of the tracked features contribute to a players' likelihood of induction. Finally, through the application of more advanced algorithms, clusters and inherent structures in the data may be revealed which can aid in the classification of players."
