# data-science-portfolio
Portfolio of various data science projects created by me for both independent learning and online classwork.

# Contents:
* [Birthdays Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/jgkissell/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Birthdays%20Data%20Vis.ipynb): A project in which I use Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to create visualizations using a dataset of birthrate data in the US. These visualizations highlight some interesting insights in the data, including noticeable dips in birthrate frequency around holidays, and on the 13th of each month.

* [MLB Hall of Fame Machine Learning](https://github.com/jgkissell/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/hof%20machine%20learning.ipynb): Creating and testing several models to predict the likelihood that MLB players will be inducted into the Hall of Fame given their career stats. Features a linear regression model, a decision tree model, and some data visualizations.

* [Covid Vaccination Map](https://github.com/jgkissell/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/US%20covid%20vaccination%20map.ipynb): A project in which I use the GeoPandas package to create informative maps visualizing Covid vaccination rates by state in the US. Also features the use of Regex, Pandas, and other Python packages to filter, clean, and merge dataframes for analysis.

* Hall of Fame Machine Learning, revisited: Another iteration of the Hall of Fame project, in which I attempt to predict if players will be inducted into the Hall of Fame given their career stats. This second iteration features more robust data, different and more advanced models, and accounts for the issues presented in the previous version.
  * [HoF Machine Learning Dataset](https://github.com/jgkissell/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/HOF%20iteration%202%20Dataframe.ipynb) Focuments the process of preparing, cleaning, organizing, and merging the data required for the project into a single, compact Pandas DataFrame.
