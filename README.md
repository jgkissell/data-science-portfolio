Portfolio of various data science projects created by me for both independent learning and online classwork.

# Contents:
* [Birthdays Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/jgkissell/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Birthdays%20Data%20Vis.ipynb): A project in which I use Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to create visualizations using a dataset of birthrate data in the US. These visualizations highlight some interesting insights in the data, including noticeable dips in birthrate frequency around holidays, and on the 13th of each month.

* [MLB Hall of Fame Machine Learning](https://github.com/jgkissell/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/hof%20machine%20learning.ipynb): Creating and testing several models to predict the likelihood that MLB players will be inducted into the Hall of Fame given their career stats. Features a linear regression model, a decision tree model, and some data visualizations.
